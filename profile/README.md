## Hi there 👋

CaesiumOS is a highly customizable OS aiming to extend the lifespans of devices. 

It is based on LineageOS to guarantee a high level of device support, so receives more sporadic and delayed updates compared to the GrapheneOS based variant ([CaesiumOS-Enhanced](https://github.com/CaesiumOS-Enhanced)). It is also significantly less secure, so the GrapheneOS-based variant (which guarantees timely updates and high security) is recommended for Pixels with Tensor processors.
